## Description
Sleep plays an integral role in everyone’s health, and many factors can impact the quality of it without proper planning. One factor that isn’t necessarily included in many sleep apps is the current phase/brightness of the moon. By helping users track lunar cycles and their own schedules in a visually concise way, we’re hoping this site might help plan for a better night’s sleep.  

**Dataset and APIs used for this application:**  
* Visual Crossing API : Collects pertinent weather data such as moon cycles  
* IPfind API: Collects the user’s location to streamline gathering relevant weather data  
* DAY.JS: Gets information about the current day  
* Bulma Calendar: Displays a responsive calendar with the current week schedule
